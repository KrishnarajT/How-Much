# Introdution and Concept
The Concept is pretty simple. This game aims to see how well you know the prices of your products. You see various products from amazon and are supposed to guess their prices. It is largely a conceptual learning exercise, as I wanted to learn how to manage various databases, connect to them as well as get better at GUI. This was a perfect and simple base to start with and execute experiements on, which also creating a template for me to add these features to any other Swing game or App that I can make. 

Refer to [The Goals](https://github.com/KrishnarajT/How-Much/blob/main/Goal.md) Of this Project to know more about this. 

# Working
1. It scraps data from amazon and stores it in a csv and or mongodb
2. It then reads from that database to show you the name and the image of a product
3. You then guess the price, and are rewarded score depending on the amount of time you have left before you choose. 
4. As you exist the Logged in Users score gets saved, which is used to Display the Highscores. 


# Installation 
1. Download the .jar file from the releases when it is released that is. 
2. Navigate there from your terminal
3. `java -jar ./How_Much.jar` should Launch it. 

# TODO
1. Update Database button doesnt really work perfectly well so fix that
2. The Options are too hard to guess and so fix that. 
3. Create Jar file lesser thats small
4. Fix File locations. 
5. Export the jar file and release it. 
6. Test on other computers. 
7. Clear Unnecessary Outputs.
8. UPDATE THE GIFS OR RESIZE IMAGES
9. Add the option to like custom look for topics on amazon and guess them only. Try to do this by creating a screen for updating the database with a few buttons, and textfield for entering the stuff. 
10. Fill this Readme up properly. 

# Credits
This was made from a lot of googling and StackoverFlow question answers. The Idea and Code was written by me. Credits to Teachers, Friends, their Opinions and creative help given by them which led to making this game. This was done as an effort to create my Project for a CSE Second Year subject Object Oriented Programming in Java. I cant believe that I have come this far. Thanks and Lots of Gratitude to everyone involved in this Journey! I had a total blast making this Game.
